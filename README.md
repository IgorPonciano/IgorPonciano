## Hi everyone!

> I’m currently working on the development of my game design bachelor's thesis, the game **Portal Dream**, a project that seeks to demonstrate and raise awareness on how the feeling of loneliness has different origins and reactions for each person, through a narrative game full of charismatic characters!
> 
> Because of that, it should be easier to find my newer contributions on the repositories hosted by my very good friend [Alexandre Monzen](https://github.com/Xandyxan)

📚 I'm currently learning C# and a bit of C, as well as general coding knowledge.

📝 I look forward to discovering better ways to write clean elegant code and to become a more complete developer.
