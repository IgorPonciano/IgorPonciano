## Hi, I'm Igor Ponciano! 👋

Member of [Aquapunk Projects](https://linktr.ee/aquapunkprojects) <br>
> Currently working on the development of the game **Portal Dream**, a project that seeks to demonstrate and raise awareness on how the feeling of loneliness has different origins and reactions for each person, through a narrative game full of charismatic characters!

📚 Learning C#, as well as general coding knowledge.

📝 I look forward to discovering better ways to write clean elegant code and to become a more complete developer.
