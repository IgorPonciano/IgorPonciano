## Hi everyone!

> Iâ€™m currently working on the development of my game design bachelor's thesis, the game **Portal Dream**, a project that seeks to demonstrate and raise awareness on how the feeling of loneliness has different origins and reactions for each person, through a narrative game full of charismatic characters!
> 
> Because of that, it should be easier to find my newer contributions on the repositories hosted by my very good friend [Alexandre Monzen](https://github.com/Xandyxan)

ðŸ“š I'm looking forward to learn new tools and languages such as C++ and Unreal Engine 5
